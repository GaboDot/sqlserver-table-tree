![Alt text](https://github.com/g4b0-88/SPLookUp/blob/master/screenshots/table_tree.png?raw=true "TableTree")

Dekstop app to build a table tree from SQL Server Database.
The app uses table's relationship to build the tree, uses recursion, so it goes as deep as your DB complexity.

# Highlights
- The process runs on background (thread)
- The result is shown as Json Treeview
- Uses table's relationships to build the tree
- Measures process time
- Exports Excel (thanks to https://docs.aspose.com/cells/net/)
- Exports Json File
