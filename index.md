Dekstop app to build a table tree from SQL Server Database.
The app uses table's relationship to build the tree, uses recursion, so it goes as deep as your DB complexity.

- The result is shown as Json Treeview
- Uses table's relationships to build the tree
- Measures process time
- Exports Excel (thanks to https://docs.aspose.com/cells/net/)
